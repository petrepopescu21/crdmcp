## Manual Claude Code Review

The Claude Code Review workflow uses manual dispatch for complete control:

### How to Run a Review:

1. **Go to Actions Tab**:
   - Navigate to **Actions** â†’ **Claude Code Review**
   - Click **Run workflow**

2. **Fill in Parameters**:
   - **PR Number**: Enter the PR number you want to review (e.g., `123`)
   - **Review Scope**: Choose focus area:
     - `full`: Complete code review covering all aspects
     - `security`: Focus on security vulnerabilities and best practices
     - `performance`: Focus on performance issues and optimizations
     - `style`: Focus on code style, formatting, and conventions

3. **Run Review**:
   - Click **Run workflow**
   - Claude will review the specified PR and post comments directly on it

### Requirements:

- **CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN**: Must be set as a repository secret
- **Permissions**: Workflow has write access to pull requests and issues
- **Manual Control**: Only runs when explicitly triggered by a maintainer

### Benefits:

- âœ… **Complete Control**: Reviews only run when you want them
- âœ… **Targeted Reviews**: Choose specific scope (security, performance, etc.)
- âœ… **No Automatic Execution**: Never runs without explicit approval
- âœ… **Flexible**: Can review any PR at any time

This approach gives you full control over when and how Claude reviews your code.
