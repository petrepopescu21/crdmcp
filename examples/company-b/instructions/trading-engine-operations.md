## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. High Latency
```bash
# Check network connectivity
ping exchange-gateway.fintech.io

# Monitor CPU usage
kubectl top pods -l app=trading-engine -n trading-prod

# Check for GC pressure
kubectl logs trading-engine-pod -n trading-prod | grep "GC"

# Review hardware acceleration status
kubectl describe tradingengine my-strategy -n trading-prod | grep hardwareAcceleration
```

#### 2. Order Rejections
```bash
# Check risk limits
kubectl get tradingengine my-strategy -n trading-prod -o jsonpath='{.status.riskMetrics}'

# Review recent orders
kubectl logs trading-engine-pod -n trading-prod | grep "ORDER_REJECT"

# Validate market connectivity
curl -k https://market-gateway.fintech.io/health
```

#### 3. Compliance Violations
```bash
# Check audit logs
kubectl logs trading-engine-pod -n trading-prod | grep "COMPLIANCE"

# Review risk metrics
kubectl get tradingengine my-strategy -n trading-prod -o yaml | grep -A 10 riskMetrics

# Generate compliance report
compliance-report --engine my-strategy --date $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Circuit Breaker Activation
```bash
# Emergency stop all trading
kubectl patch tradingengine my-strategy -n trading-prod -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"riskLimit":"0%"}}}'

# Or pause the engine completely
kubectl patch tradingengine my-strategy -n trading-prod -p '{"status":{"phase":"Emergency-Stop"}}'
```

#### Disaster Recovery
1. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope of failure
2. **Stop Trading**: Activate emergency stop
3. **Preserve State**: Backup current positions and orders
4. **Failover**: Switch to backup systems
5. **Recovery**: Restore from last known good state
6. **Validation**: Verify all systems before restart
