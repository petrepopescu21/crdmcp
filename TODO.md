# Generic CRD MCP Server Implementation TODO

## ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

All planned tasks have been successfully completed. The CRD MCP Server is now fully functional with:
- âœ… Complete MCP server implementation with 4 tools
- âœ… Comprehensive CLI with start, validate, info, and generate commands
- âœ… Enhanced logging system with progress indicators and performance metrics
- âœ… 113+ tests across 9 test suites
- âœ… Two complete example company structures (Acme Corp & FinTech Corp)
- âœ… Extensive documentation including README, USAGE_GUIDE, EXAMPLES, and QUICK_START

## Project Overview
Create a reusable MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that any company can use to load their own Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), sample manifests, and custom instructions. This enables employees to work with Claude Code to create and manage company-specific infrastructure resources.

## Use Case Flow
1. **Company A** has internal CRDs for their tooling/infrastructure (databases, queues, services, etc.)
2. **Company A** starts the MCP server pointing to their data directory with CRDs, samples, and instructions
3. **Employee** connects Claude Code to the MCP server and says: "I want a new Redis database and give the user-service access to it"
4. **Claude** uses the MCP tools to understand available CRDs, examine samples, read instructions, then helps create the appropriate manifests
